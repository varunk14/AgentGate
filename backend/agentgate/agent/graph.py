"""LangGraph demo agent + human-in-the-loop (DECISIONS D30).

A thin graph over the real gate:

    propose --(valid)--> gate --(allowed)--> END
        |                  |
     (failed)          (escalate / cap)
        \\----------------> human (interrupt: approve | reject) --> END

The agent is given a structured Invoice and proposes a payment action via the LLM
(the router is the only mock seam). The retry loop is the generalized
``run_with_retry`` with a VALUE-ONLY LLM re-proposer (D30): the loop owns which
field changes; the re-proposer returns only the new value, so the LLM can never
declare an adjustment (BLOCK->ESCALATE) or drift action_type/invoice_number.

Fail-closed (D11): a malformed LLM proposal or re-proposal routes to a human,
never a crash or an infinite loop. The gate's Decision is never rewritten by a
human approval (D25) — approval is the graph's resolution, recorded alongside the
untouched (ESCALATE) verdict.

Graph state is JSON-safe (plain dicts, not pydantic models): it survives any
checkpointer without relying on serde type-reconstruction, and it is exactly what
the Slice 7 API/dashboard will consume. Pydantic lives in the core and is
reconstructed inside nodes.
