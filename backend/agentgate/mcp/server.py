"""AgentGate as an MCP server (PRD SS10 Slice 8, D44).

One tool — ``verify_action`` — wrapping the pure ``decide()`` in-process under
the SAME envelope and fail-closed contract as the HTTP boundary (D35): the
request validates through ``VerifyRequest`` (bounds, ``extra="forbid"``, po
rejected), the tool ALWAYS returns a Decision dict and never raises to the MCP
client (an MCP tool *error* would sit outside the Decision vocabulary and
invite the calling agent to retry or route around the gate), and the boundary
fields are stamped identically. The duplicate store and tracing wire from the
same environment variables as the HTTP app; ``/verify`` semantics apply — the
tool is read-only.

Run it over stdio: ``agentgate-mcp`` (console script) or
``python -m agentgate.mcp.server``.

    score. ``source`` either contains a structured ``invoice`` and optional

    rejected into a fail-closed escalate (AgentGate keeps money exact). A
