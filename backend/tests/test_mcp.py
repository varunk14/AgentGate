"""MCP surface (PRD SS10 Slice 8, D44).

verify_action wraps decide() in-process under the SAME envelope and fail-closed
contract as the HTTP boundary: the same VerifyRequest validation (bounds,
extra="forbid", po rejected), a Decision dict ALWAYS returned — never an
exception surfaced to the MCP client — and the same boundary stamping. Money
must arrive as JSON strings: the MCP transport parses JSON before AgentGate
sees it, so a numeric amount is an already-lossy float and is rejected by the
D1 validator into a fail-closed escalate with an instructive message.
